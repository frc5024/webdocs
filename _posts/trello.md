# Programming Trello
In the [programming board](https://trello.com/b/I951ouOI/programming), we both keep track of tasks and also plan meetings. Check the board frequently to make sure you know what has been assigned to you. If you need help on a task, add the `Requires Assistance` tag.

## Up for grabs
All tasks in this list have not been claimed or assigned to a team member. Need something to work on? Grab one of these!

## Ideas
These are project ideas, offseason plans, and other things to think about or try out.
