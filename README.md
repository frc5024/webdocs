# Welcome
Webdocs is a collection of notes and guides compiled by our team. 

This webpage was originally created to archive entries in the #programming-notes channel of our team slack, but has quickly expanded to become much more.

## Contributing to the page
To contribute, you should have a decent knowledge of [Markdown](https://www.markdownguide.org/getting-started). 

Head over to [frc5024/webdocs](https://github.com/frc5024/webdocs) on GitHub and create a pull request with your changes.

The documentation is built automatically and pushed to our website every few minutes.

## Creating a new page
This site is now using [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) for it's backend. Anything outlined in their documentation will work here. Be sure to check other files for example header info. Your page WILL not be visible until the header is set correctly. If you have questions, check with a mentor or the programming team lead.'

## Theme docs
For documentation on how to create nav structures, UI elements, and other more advanced settings, check out the [theme documentation](https://pmarsceill.github.io/just-the-docs/)

## Adding your name to the contributors list
Simply ass your github username (all lowercase) to the `authors` array defined in the page's header. If an `authors` array is not present, it will not be displayed.
