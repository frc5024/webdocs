# Lib5K Reference
This section contains the documentation for [Lib5K](https://github.com/frc5024/lib5k), our team's library for all of our robots.


## Why Lib5K?
Lib5K was designed by @ewpratten over the summer of 2019 to provide a unified collection of wrappers, utilities, and control systems for 5024. 

## Updates and adding to a project
The Lib5K repo is not actively updated. It is just a snapshot of the library. Every month or so, the current Lib5K lib should be copied into the repo. To add it to a project, just drop the library into `src/main/java/frc/`.
