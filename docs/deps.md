# Dependancy URLs
These URLs are used by WPIlib to add external libraries to our codebase. 
They are hard to remember, so here is a list of the ones we use:

## NAVX

https://www.kauailabs.com/dist/frc/2019/navx_frc.json
```

## CTRE
```
http://devsite.ctr-electronics.com/maven/release/com/ctre/phoenix/Phoenix-latest.json
```

## REV Robotics

```

## PathFinder
