# Dependency URLs
These URLs are used by WPIlib to add external libraries to our codebase. 
They are hard to remember, so here is a list of the ones we use:

## NAVX
```
https://www.kauailabs.com/dist/frc/2019/navx_frc.json
```

## CTRE
```
http://devsite.ctr-electronics.com/maven/release/com/ctre/phoenix/Phoenix-latest.json
```

## REV Robotics
```
http://www.revrobotics.com/content/sw/max/sdk/REVRobotics.json
```

## PathFinder
```
https://dev.imjac.in/maven/jaci/pathfinder/PathfinderOLD-latest.json
```
