# Robot Programming Quick-Reference
This section if Webdocs is dedicated to tutorials on the various aspects of programming one of our robots. For a full robot programming guide, take a look at [FRC-PDR](https://frc-pdr.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html).

## Worcester Polytechnic Institute
A group of robotics students from Worcester Polytechnic Institute (WPI) created and maintain a great library of code for use on our robots. This code contains simple interfaces and wrappers for almost everything you will need to do on the robot.

These days, almost every single FRC team uses this library, called WPIlib, to assist them in the process of programming their robots. We are one of these teams, and some of our team members even help maintain the library over on [GitHub](https://github.com/wpilibsuite/allwpilib)!

## Prerequisites
This guide assumes the following:
 - You have [intalled the WPIlib tools on your computer](https://wpilib.screenstepslive.com/s/currentCS/m/java/l/1027503-installing-c-and-java-development-tools-for-frc)
 - You have a basic understanding of Java or C++
 - You are familiar with object-oriented programming
