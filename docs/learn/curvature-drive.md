# Constant Curvature Drive

Curvature Drive is a method inside of DifferentialDrive that is similar to Arcade Drive or Tank Drive. All of these methods complete the same basic function; sending informations to the motors on how much to move and in which direction. 

# What does constant curvature mean?
Constant Curvature is an idea from differential geometry. Curvature is defined at every point on a surface or plane. A sphere is an example of a surface with constant curvature and a cycloid curve has two dimentional constant curvature.
