## Robot features
Darth Raider is a robot design to score in the upper goal port. Darth Raider uses a LimeLight for a multitude of tasks including target tracking, odometry, and correctly setting flywheel speeds to allow for the most accurate shoots possible, all done with a touch of a button. The Robot is programmed using a state machine design, which allows the drivers to do almost every task from shooting to intaking balls, with one click of a button.

Autonomous was designed using dead reckoning along with pure pursuit to get from point A to point B. The paths are not pre-plan and are generated by the robot.
