## Robot features
This robot can phase between higher dimensions, and alternate realities. It has small rockets on gimbals, in place of swerve, and can score a 50 cube auto, even if there are no cubes to be found.

Autonomous is handled by the quantum computer we hid in one of the pneumatic storage tanks, and will just figure out how to win without driver inputs. Our drive team is just there to get front-row seats.
