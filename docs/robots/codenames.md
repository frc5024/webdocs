# Codenames
In the time between kickoff and revealing the official name of our robot, the programming team uses codenames to refer to each bot. It has become tradition to name a robot after each graduating member of the season. These are the codenames we have used in the past:

| Codename | Robot |

| FraserIsTheBest | [Q*bert]({{site.baseurl}}/docs/robots/qbert) |
| MattIsBetter | [HATCHfield]({{site.baseurl}}/docs/robots/hatchfield) |
| ParsaIsPreferable | 2019 Practice bot |
