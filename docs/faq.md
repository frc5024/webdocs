# Frequently Asked Questions

## Why do I get build errors from the Compressor subsystem?
This is due to a namespacing issue. We generally try to use other names that mean the same thing. In the past, the names: `cCompressor`, `Pressurizer`, and `Pneumatics` where used to fix this problem. Not enough information has been gathered yet to file a bug report upstream with the WPIlib team.
