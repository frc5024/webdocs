# Installing DriverStation
This guide is adapted from the [Toronto Coding Collective](https://www.torontocodingcollective.com)

The National Instruments Update Suite contains the DriverStation software and some of the tools required to configure the robot hardware. Click the download button below. You will need to create a National Instruments account to download the FRC Update Suite. The activation key can be found in the Programming cabinet at the back of the first shelf but is not required for a trial installation.

WPILib provides [complete instructions](https://frc-docs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/docs/software/getting-started/frc-update-suite.html) for installing the National Instruments Update Suite.  Key components in the suite are:

 - Driver Station - used to connect to and drive the robot
 - RoboRio Imaging Tool - used to re-image a RoboRio and assign a team number to the hardware
