# Installing FRC Development Tools
Due to the fact that our team allows Linux, OSX, and Windows to be used by our programmers, creating one definitive installation guide is not feasible. Instead, here are three separate guides from the WPIlib team for each os we support. Keep in mind that we are a Java team when following instructions.

 - [Linux](https://frc-docs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/docs/getting-started/getting-started-frc-control-system/wpilib-setup.html)
 - [Windows](https://frc-docs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/docs/getting-started/getting-started-frc-control-system/wpilib-setup.html)
 - [Mac OS](https://frc-docs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/docs/getting-started/getting-started-frc-control-system/wpilib-setup.html)
