# Team Reference
Due to the fact the our team manual only releases yearly, this section of the webdocs contains a copy of many pages from the programming manual. This copy is constantly updated, and is generally the first place a programmer should look for information on team rules and guides. 

All additions and edits to this section will be taken into consideration when building the next year's manual.
