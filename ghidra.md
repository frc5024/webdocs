# Disasembly
Sometimes, it is helpful to know exactly what the compiler is doing with your code. A great approach isi to pass the outputted executable through a disasembler, but many people are immeadiatly turned off by the hundred dollar price tags on some of these tools. Enter Ghidra, the binary analysis tool made by the [NSA](https://github.com/NationalSecurityAgency). This is possibly the best tool out there, and it is completely free and open source!

## Installation
Ghidra can be installed for any operation system at: [ghidra-sre.org](https://ghidra-sre.org/)
