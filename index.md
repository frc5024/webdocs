# 5024 Documentation

This website is the home of notes and documentation from the 5024 programming team, and it's mentors. This site is constantly updated with new information, and is the first place any team member should look when trying to solve a problem.

If you are having a problem with WPIlib, CTRE, or Pathfinder, or someone has told you to check the "list of blinky things", take a look at the [External Documentation](/webdocs/docs/external) section.
